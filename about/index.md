I grew up in Vermont, studied Economics in college and then [Cybersecurity](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/cybersecurity-ms) in grad school. 

In 2009, I married [Ruolin (Sarah) Cui](https://github.com/ruolincui) in Boston, and we moved to DC shortly thereafter to work as consultants. From 2010 until 2012, I consulted for the municipal government's Office of the Chief Financial Officer. In 2012, we moved to New York. For the first several years, I worked as a Data Scientist at the securities litigation firm [Labaton Sucharow](https://www.labaton.com/) where I worked with forensic accountants and lawers to create models to identify and get out ahead of corporate malfeasance.

In 2016, I went to work for [JP Morgan Chase & Co](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) as a Data Science Product Manager where I prototyped fraud detection products and then worked with my scrum team to get them operationalized. In 2021, I took on my current role as a Security Architect where I'm focused on identifying vulnerabilities, threat modeling, and risk prioritization. 

I frequently help friends and family with programming / data mining projects, so feel free to reach out to me if you have an interesting project you would like help with. In my spare time, I am an avid forecaster. I'm an [INFER all-star (top 10 forecaster)](https://www.infer-pub.com/forecaster/JonathanMann) and a member of [Samotsvety](https://samotsvety.org/). I blog at [abstraction.substack.com](abstraction.substack.com).
