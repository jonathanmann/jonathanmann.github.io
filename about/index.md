![ScreenShot](public/img/profile.jpg)

I grew up in [Jericho, Vermont](http://www.jerichovt.gov/), graduated from [SUNY New Paltz](http://www.newpaltz.edu/) in Economics. In late 2009, I married Ruolin (Sarah) Cui in Boston, Massachusetts.

Two years ago, my wife and I moved from DC, where we worked as consultants, to NYC. Currently, I work as a software developer and data analyst for the securities class action law firm [Labaton Sucharow](http://labaton.com/), and my wife is a director at [Mokobio](http://mokobio.com/), a Chinese biotech company.

At work, in addition to developing and maintaining custom applications, I write algorithms to look for corporate malfeasance.

I am a member of [the New York Python Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/nycpython/), and an eager learner of Haskell.
