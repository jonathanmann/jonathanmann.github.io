I grew up in [Jericho, Vermont](http://www.jerichovt.gov/), graduated from [SUNY New Paltz](http://www.newpaltz.edu/) in Economics, and work as a software developer and data analyst for the securities class action law firm [Labaton Sucharow](http://labaton.com/). 

At work, in addition to developing and maintaining custom applications, I write algorithms to look for corporate malfeasance.

I am a member of [the New York Python Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/nycpython/), and an eager learner of Haskell.
