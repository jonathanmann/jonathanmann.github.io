### Forecasting
I'm a forcaster for [Samotsvety](https://samotsvety.org/), a [Good Judgement Superforecaster](https://www.credential.net/a5fc2da6-e001-4478-8812-f03a6e370b10#gs.y1449y) and an [INFER All-Star](https://www.infer-pub.com/forecaster/JonathanMann).

One of my missions is to drive the wider adoption of forecasts as a tool for making sense of the world. Since forecasters are judged on their track records, and not by how many views or likes they receive, they have the right incentives for accuracy.

### Writing
I started a substack called [Abstraction](https://abstraction.substack.com/) where I write about AI safety, existential risk, prediction markets, forecasting, and other related topics.

### Cybersecurity
In everyday life, I work as a [Security Architect at JP Morgan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mannjonathan/). I'm particularly excited about applications for public key cryptography.

### Software Projects
I love building and prototyping software! LLM-based coding assistants have [made the process even better](https://jonathanmann.github.io/2022/12/23/logo-detection-with-open-cv/). As I have time, I'm working on [Grantkey](https://grantkey.com/) and have plans to train a small LLM for specialized for database interaction.
