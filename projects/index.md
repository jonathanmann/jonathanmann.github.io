### Open Source Projects

#### Building Tools for Democracy
I'm very interested in contributing to the construction of tools that will help create a more just and transparent democracy. One tool that I think could do tremendous good across the world is an election system that is both transparent and verifiable while still preserving voter privacy. I wrote more about this in the post [Modeling Verifiable Voting that Protects Privacy](http://jonathanmann.github.io/2015/08/29/transparent-verifialbe-private-elections/).


### Proprietary Projects

#### Stock Market Prediction
While I believe that, for the most part, the best approximation for the expected value of alpha is zero, my suspicion is that there are occasional non-repeatable opportunities where the market misjudges the risk premium that should be placed on a particular security. Whenever I am successful in identifying such an opportunity, I will write about it once the economic profits from the strategy have been competed away. Additionally, whenever I identify a strategy without benefits, I will be sure to share it right away as in the post [Price Targets a Poor Predictor of Performance](http://jonathanmann.github.io/2015/07/13/price-targets-poor-predictor/).

#### Link Rating Tools
[NodeHeap](http://nodeheap.herokuapp.com/#/home) is a prototype for a link rating tool where users can submit links and have them rated by the community. The current incarnation of the app was developed with the MEAN stack and is hosted on Heroku. I will probably move the next deployment over to AWS.
